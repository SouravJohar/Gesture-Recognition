# Hand Gesture Recognition Using JAVA(Open CV)
A simple program where you can use your hand to control the volume and the brightness of your computer


**Dependencies:**

1.     
Latest version of [JAVA](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

2.     
[OpenCV](http://opencv.org/downloads.html)

3.     
[PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)

4.     
 [Nircmd](http://download.cnet.com/NirCmd/3000-2094_4-77191.html)

**Directions****:**

1.     
Compile and run the program

2.     
Once the GUI is opened, click on start video

3.     
Place your palm in the yellow box and click capture
histogram

4.     
On the right screen you should see a green
outline around your hand

5.     
If the green outline isn’t perfect, place your
hand at in the center and keep clicking capture histogram until proper

6.     
The upper circle is for volume, and the lower
one for brightness

7.     
To simulate a click, keep your hand in an L
shape, and move your thumb close to the center of the palm

8.     
Do this in any one of the circles and drag it to
the left or to the right to change the brightness or volume

9.     
Click stop video before closing the frame,
otherwise, the scripts running in the background won’t stop

** ****Notes:**

·       
This only works for windows for now (Will
provide multiplatform support soon)

·       
Works only with right hand (Will support left
hand soon)

·       
You must download OpenCV and add it to the
project path yourself using whichever IDE you use

·       
PowerShell has to be above version 2.0

·       
If you are a windows user (above win 7) you don’t
have to download PowerShell explicitly

·       
You have to place nircmd.exe outside the src folder inorder for this to work
